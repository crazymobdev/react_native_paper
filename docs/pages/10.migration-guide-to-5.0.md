# Migration guide to Material You (5.0)

Version 5.0 brings a support for new Material Design called Material You (MD3) into `react-native-paper` library. All the components were refined according to the official [design kit on figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) and adjusted in terms of visual by changes in colors, typography and animations. 

Below you can find the most important information about the components which API has been changed due to supporting new props, renaming existing one or some deprecations. Hopefully, based on the presented required changes, migration to the latest version should be smooth. Enjoy!

## Theming

### Versioning

Introducing Material You (MD3) into `react-native-paper` doesn't mean dropping previous Material Design (MD2)! On the contrary, both of them will be supported, however not simultaneously. To specify which design system components should follow in the app, there is a newly created property in the theme, called `version`, which can accept only one of two values:

* 3 ‚Äì new Material You (MD3)
* 2 - previous Material Design (MD2)

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  version: 3 (default) | 2
}
```

### Roundness


### Colors

New theme introduces new color palette along with new namings reflecting design color tokens, but written in camel case. Palette contains set of five key colors, where primary, secondary and tertiary are classified into _accent colors_. The second group of colors is neutral and neutral variant colors used for defining surface or background roles as well as specifying high and medium emphasis text and icons. Additionaly, scolor system includes a semantic color role for error.

Each of accent and error colors has group of related tones. The tones are mapped to roles that create contrast and visual interest when applied to elements in the UI.

üìç Note: Dynamic colors are not supported yet.

Colors theme structure should follow the default palette and contain the following properties:

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  colors: {
    primary,
    primaryContainer,
    secondary,
    secondaryContainer,
    tertiary,
    tertiaryContainer,
    surface,
    surfaceVariant,
    surfaceDisabled,
    background,
    error,
    errorContainer,
    onPrimary,
    onPrimaryContainer,
    onSecondary,
    onSecondaryContainer,
    onTertiary,
    onTertiaryContainer,
    onSurface,
    onSurfaceVariant,
    onSurfaceDisabled,
    onError,
    onErrorContainer,
    onBackground,
    outline,
    shadow,
    inverseOnSurface,
    inverseSurface,
    inversePrimary,
  }
}
```

## Typography

New way of approaching typography introduces one component `<Text>` which accepts prop `variant`. Variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size. The updated type scale organizes styles into five roles that are named to describe their purposes: Display, Headline, Title, Label and Body along with three display styles large, medium, and small. In sum, there are fifteen variants that are MD3 compliant and are reflecting design typography tokens written in camel case. 

```js
<Text variant="displayLarge">Display Large</Text>
<Text variant="displayMedium">Display Medium</Text>
<Text variant="displaySmall">Display small</Text>

<Text variant="headlineLarge">Headline Large</Text>
<Text variant="headlineMedium">Headline Medium</Text>
<Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline Small</Text>

<Text variant="titleLarge">Title Large</Text>
<Text variant="titleMedium">Title Medium</Text>
<Text variant="titleSmall">Title Small</Text>

<Text variant="bodyLarge">Body Large</Text>
<Text variant="bodyMedium">Body Medium</Text>
<Text variant="bodySmall">Body Small</Text>

<Text variant="labelLarge">Label Large</Text>
<Text variant="labelMedium">Label Medium</Text>
<Text variant="labelSmall">Label Small</Text>
 ```
