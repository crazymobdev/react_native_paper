# Migration guide to Material You (5.0)

Version 5.0 brings a support for new Material Design called Material You <i>(MD3)</i> into `react-native-paper` library. All the components were refined according to the official [design kit on figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) and adjusted in terms of visual by changes in colors, typography and animations. 

Below you can find the most important information about the components which API has been changed due to supporting new props, renaming existing one or some deprecations. Hopefully, based on the presented required changes, migration to the latest version should be smooth. Enjoy!

## Theming

### Versioning

Introducing Material You <i>(MD3)</i> into `react-native-paper` doesn't mean dropping previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>! On the contrary, both of them will be supported, however not simultaneously. To specify which design system components should follow in the app, there is a newly created property in the theme, called `version`, which can accept only one of two values:

* 3 ‚Äì new Material You <i>(MD3)</i>
* 2 - previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  version: 3 (default) | 2
}
```

### Roundness


### Colors

New theme introduces new color palette along with new namings reflecting design color tokens, but written in camel case. Palette contains set of five key colors, where primary, secondary and tertiary are classified into <i>accent colors</i>. The second group of colors is <i>neutral and neutral variant colors</i> used for defining surface or background roles as well as specifying high and medium emphasis text and icons. Additionaly, scolor system includes a semantic color role for error.

Each of accent and error colors has group of related tones. The tones are mapped to roles that create contrast and visual interest when applied to elements in the UI.

üìç<i>Note: Dynamic colors are not supported yet.</i>

Colors theme structure should follow the default palette and contain the following properties:

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  colors: {
    primary,
    primaryContainer,
    secondary,
    secondaryContainer,
    tertiary,
    tertiaryContainer,
    surface,
    surfaceVariant,
    surfaceDisabled,
    background,
    error,
    errorContainer,
    onPrimary,
    onPrimaryContainer,
    onSecondary,
    onSecondaryContainer,
    onTertiary,
    onTertiaryContainer,
    onSurface,
    onSurfaceVariant,
    onSurfaceDisabled,
    onError,
    onErrorContainer,
    onBackground,
    outline,
    shadow,
    inverseOnSurface,
    inverseSurface,
    inversePrimary,
  }
}
```

## Typography

New way of approaching typography introduces one component `<Text>` which accepts prop `variant`. Variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size. The updated type scale organizes styles into five roles that are named to describe their purposes: <b>Display</b>, <b>Headline</b>, <b>Title</b>, <b>Label</b> and <b>Body</b> along with three display styles <i>large</i>, <i>medium</i>, and <i>small</i>. In sum, there are fifteen variants that are MD3 compliant and are reflecting design typography tokens written in camel case. 

```js
<Text variant="displayLarge">Display Large</Text>
<Text variant="displayMedium">Display Medium</Text>
<Text variant="displaySmall">Display small</Text>

<Text variant="headlineLarge">Headline Large</Text>
<Text variant="headlineMedium">Headline Medium</Text>
<Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline Small</Text>

<Text variant="titleLarge">Title Large</Text>
<Text variant="titleMedium">Title Medium</Text>
<Text variant="titleSmall">Title Small</Text>

<Text variant="bodyLarge">Body Large</Text>
<Text variant="bodyMedium">Body Medium</Text>
<Text variant="bodySmall">Body Small</Text>

<Text variant="labelLarge">Label Large</Text>
<Text variant="labelMedium">Label Medium</Text>
<Text variant="labelSmall">Label Small</Text>
 ```

## Surface

## BottomNavigation <i>(Navigation bar)</i>

## Divider

`Divider` component received two new props:

* `bold` - divider is bolded
* `horizontalInset` - divider has horizontal insets on both sides

Additionaly prop `inset` was renamed to `leftInset`.

```diff
- <Divider inset />
+ <Divider leftInset />
```

## Drawer.CollapsedItem <i>(Navigation rail)</i>

`Drawer.CollapsedItem` is a newly created side navigation component that can be used within `Drawer`, representing a destination in form of action item with an icon and optionally label.

üìç<i>Note: It's working only with theme version 3.</i>

```js
<Drawer.Section>
  <Drawer.CollapsedItem
    icon="inbox"
    label="Inbox"
  />
  <Drawer.CollapsedItem
    icon="star"
    label="Starred"
  />
</Drawer.Section>
```

## Menu.Item

`Menu.Item` received two new props:

* `dense` sets smaller item height for more condensed layout,
* `trailingIcon` which handles displaying icon at the end of the item row. 

```js
<Menu.Item dense trailingIcon="chevron-up">
```

At the same time, by analogy to the second new prop, the `icon` prop was renamed to `leadingIcon`.

```diff
- <Menu.Item icon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />
+ <Menu.Item leadingIcon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />
```

## Floating Action Buttons

`FAB`, `AnimatedFAB` and `FAB.Group` in the latest version can be used with four various variants and two modes, due to two new following props:

* `variant` defines color mappings variant for combinations of container and icon colors. Can be one of: <b>primary</b> <i>(default)</i>, <b>secondary</b>, <b>tertiary</b> or <b>surface</b>.

```js
<FAB variant="tertiary" />
```

* `mode` specifies whether button should <b>flat</b> or <b>elevated</b>:
   - `flat` - button without a shadow.
   - `elevated` - button with a shadow.

```js
<FAB mode="flat" />
```

### FAB

Additionaly `FAB` may be applied in one of three available size, thanks to new prop `size`: 

* `small` - FAB with small height (40).
* `medium` - Appbar with default medium height (56).
* `large` - Appbar with large height (96).

```js
<FAB size="large" />
```

Accordingly to introducing `size="small"`, prop `small` was deprecated.

```diff
- <FAB small />
+ <FAB size="small" />
```

### FAB.Group

There is also deprecation in one of the `actions` properties, namely `small` prop is deprecated and replaced in favour of default `size="small"`.

```diff
- <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", small }]} />
+ <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus" }]}>
```

## Appbar <i>(Top app bar)</i>

`Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` in the latest version can be used in four various modes due to new prop `mode`:

* `small` - Appbar with default height <i>(56) (default)</i>
* `medium` - Appbar with medium height <i>(112)</i>
* `large` - Appbar with large height <i>(152)</i>
* `center-aligned` - Appbar with default height <i>(56)</i> and center-aligned title.

```js
<Appbar mode="center-aligned">
  /* ... */
</Appbar>
```
 
It's worth to notice that by default `Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` don't have a shadow, however it can be added by passing prop `elevated` into the component:

```js
<Appbar elevated>
  /* ... */
</Appbar>
```

### Appbar.Action

`Appbar.Action` received new prop `isLeading`, which defines whether it's the <b>leading</b> button and should be place at the beginning of the `Appbar`.

```js
<Appbar.Action isLeading icon="magnify" onPress={() => {}} />
```

### Appbar.Content

New design guidelines indicates there is no <b>subtitle</b> in `Appbar.Content`, that's why there are two deprecations and following props won't be supported anymore: `subtitle` and `subtitleStyle`.

```diff
- <Appbar.Content title="Title" subtitle="Subtitle" styles={styles.subtitle} />
+ <Appbar.Content title="Title" />
```

## Chip

## Button

## Dialog.Icon

`Dialog.Icon` is a another freshly added component presenting an icon within a `Dialog`, placed at the top of the content.

üìç<i>Note: It's working only with theme version 3.</i>

```js
<Portal>
  <Dialog visible={visible} onDismiss={hideDialog}>
    <Dialog.Icon icon="alert" />
  </Dialog>
</Portal>
```
